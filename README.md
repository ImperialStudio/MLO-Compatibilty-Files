<h3>Instructions</h3>
1. Remove/Delete hw1_23_0.ybn & hi@hw1_23_0.ybn from the Applestore MLO stream folder.<br>
2. Place these 2 merged .ybn collision files into the Dr Pills Pharmacy stream folder overwriting the 2 files with the same name.<br>
<br>
Now both mlos will be able to run at the same time without conflicting collisions.<br>
